GPU Cloth Simulation For Real-time Application
---

This repository is still currently in development, so everything is still in testing mode. A lot of things will break, download at your own risk :\

My goal is to replicate what this legend did: https://youtu.be/kCGHXlLR3l8 (A smooth and interactive cloth simulation)

Currently, my cloth simulation uses Postion Based Dynamics and supports:
- Distance Constraint
- Bending Constraint
- Mesh Collision (not really working yet, will soon be deprecated and replaced by voxell collision)

Features comming soon:
- Voxell Collision
- Aerodynamics (lift and drag) [Wind Effect]
- Primitive Shape Collision (Sphere, Box and Capsule)


Check out my YouTube Playlist where I record my journey on how I approach this problem!
