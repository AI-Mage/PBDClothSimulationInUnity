GPU Cloth Simulation For Real-time Application
---

This repository is still currently under development, so everything is still in testing mode. A lot of things will break, download at your own risk :/

My goal is to replicate what this legend did: https://youtu.be/kCGHXlLR3l8 (A smooth and interactive cloth simulation)

Currently, my cloth simulation uses Postion Based Dynamics and supports:
- Distance Constraint
- Bending Constraint
- Mesh Collision (not really working yet)

Features comming soon:
- Self Collision
- Aerodynamics (lift and drag) [Wind Effect]
- Vivace Gauss Seidel Method for optimization on GPU (random graph coloring)
- Primitive Shape Collision (Sphere, Box and Capsule)


Check out my [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlnBGPe6GFdP8So9oS0YVoVjqkmJoREI_) where I record my journey on how I approach this problem!
